        <h1 class="heading1" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 500;"> Why I joined Andela Technical Leadership
            program</h1>

        <p class="par1">Before joining Andela Technical Leadership Program, I was learning web development on my
            own using various online resources such as YouTube, udemy, freecodecamp, and so on. However I couldn’t build
            a project on my own without using tutorials. When I read the ATLP announcement, I immediately knew that this
            was exactly what I needed. I am already into it for only one month and it has been an amazing experience so
            far.
        </p>
        <p>
            Andela has structured the program in a way that is efficient to produce software developers as quickly as
            possible. It’s basically project-based learning. It is divided into three phases. The first phase is the
            Bootcamp phase where we will be using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the blog-portfolio site. The second
            one is the project phase where we will team up to build the full web application. I am excited about this
            phase because it will expose me to the technologies I couldn’t have learned on my own such as PostgreSQL,
            Express JS, Nodejs, Docker, React/Redux JS and so on. The last phase is the apprenticeship phase which is
            basically to work on real products in certain company in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the entire program, I will be able to develop other important skills needed to become a
            successful software engineer. Every week, we are having a professional skill session with Mr. Joshua
            Tahinduka, the reputed and award-winning public speaker. We are learning from his years’ experience as a
            public speaker and he is encouraging us to communicate even though we don’t feel like it. He emphasizes that
            we need to learn skills like communication, teamwork, and time management if we want to really become
            successful software developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorable thing about Andela is the kind of mentorship I get here. There are experienced engineers
            willing to help with any problem I have. We have even technical Team Leaders in our team who are with us
            every step of the journey. He checks on us every day and he makes sure that we are making progress depending
            on what we are supposed to know.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being at Andela is a privilege for me. I feel like I am part of something big that aims at transforming our
            continent. After the program, I am planning to work as a freelancer for a couple of months before working at
            any company because I already have a couple of projects in mind that I want to work on. Then I will join a
            company that is working on projects that are making a positive impact in people’s life.
